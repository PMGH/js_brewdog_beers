## Visualising all that beer:    

This mini project stemmed from a lab class at CodeClan in Glasgow. Data was retrieved from the BrewDog Punk API (https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers) using an XMLHttpRequest, event listeners and callbacks. The API data was then visualised by dynamically creating unordered list (ul) and list (li) HTML elements using JavaScript and appending them to the appropriate HTML parent elements. The HTML was then styled using CSS by targeting classes and ids that were dynamically assigned during element creation.  


## Built With:  
* JavaScipt   
* BrewDog Punk API (https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers)  


## Authors
